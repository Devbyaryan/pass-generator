# Pass-Generator

**Pass-Generator** is a simple yet powerful password generator built using React and Vite. This project demonstrates the use of React hooks such as `useRef`, `useCallback`, and `useEffect`, offering an interactive UI to generate secure passwords.

## Features

- **Password Generation**: Generates passwords with a length ranging from 8 to 20 characters.
- **Character Options**: Includes options to add numbers and special characters to the generated password.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the generated password to your clipboard with a single click.
- **Responsive UI**: Built with Tailwind CSS to provide a clean and responsive user interface.

## Learning Objectives

- **React Hooks**: Gained hands-on experience with essential React hooks (`useRef`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`).
- **State Management**: Managed state effectively to control password length, character inclusion, and password display.
- **Vite**: Leveraged Vite for a fast and efficient development environment.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Enhanced the user experience with a beautiful and responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
